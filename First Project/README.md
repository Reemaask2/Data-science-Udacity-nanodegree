Obesity levels Data analysis

Installations:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matpoltlib

- SciPy

I was really interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using Obesity Levels dataset found on Kaggle to better understand:

- What is the overall Obesity levels ditribution? 
- What is the Obesity levels distribution over Age Groups?
- Is there a relationship between frequent consumption of high caloric food and obesity?
- Is there a relationship between the time spent using technological devices and obesity levels?
- Is there a relationship between family history of overweight and obesity levels?

I was eager to analyze the data thoroughly, communicate interesting findings, and share them on Medium blog post  which I really hope it is an engaging post and insightful for you :)
