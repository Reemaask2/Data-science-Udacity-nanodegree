This repository has all the code and report for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project.

Starbucks Capstone Challenge: Using Starbucks app user data to tailor marketing messages to each segment, maximizing engagement and conversion rates

1. Installations:
This project was written in Python, using online Jupyter Notebook. The relevant Python packages for this project are as below:

- pandas 
- numpy as 
- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- datetime 
- sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
- sklearn.cluster import KMeans

2. Project Motivation:
This project is the Capstone project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. As students, we had the option to take part in the Starbucks Capstone Challenge. For the challenge, Udacity provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Thanks for both of them!! 

3: Problem Statement
To optimize the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns, we aim to segment app users into distinct groups based on their responsiveness to different promotional offers. By leveraging K-means clustering techniques, we seek to identify patterns among users, distinguishing those who are more receptive to discounts, those who prefer buy-one-get-one (BOGO) offers, and those who show little interest in promotions. The ultimate goal is to tailor marketing messages to each segment, maximizing engagement and conversion rates

How can we leverage data science techniques to optimize direct marketing campaigns? Specifically, how can we segment app users into distinct groups based on their responsiveness to various promotional offers? By utilizing K-means clustering techniques, how can we identify patterns among users to differentiate between those who prefer discounts, those who favor buy-one-get-one (BOGO) offers, and those who exhibit minimal interest in promotions? Ultimately, how can we tailor marketing messages to each segment to maximize engagement and conversion rates?
