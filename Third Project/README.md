-Project Motivitation 
For this project, my real insterest was in analyzing users engagegemnt with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and providing personalized recommendations for new articles that they would like. The project was divided into the following key tasks:

1- Exploratory Data Analysis: This involved diving into the dataset to gain insights into user-article interactions, such as the most popular articles and user activity patterns.
2- Rank-Based Recommendations: I developed a recommendation system based on article popularity, where articles were recommended to users. 
3- User-User Collaborative Filtering: Another approach involved leveraging similarities between users to make recommendations. By identifying users with similar preferences, we could suggest articles that were well-received by users with similar preferences.
5- Matrix Factorization: Lastly, I explored matrix factorization techniques to model user-item interactions and uncover latent factors underlying user preferences. This allowed for more personalized recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.
